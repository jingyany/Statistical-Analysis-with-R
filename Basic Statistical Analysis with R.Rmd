## Data Set 1: airquality


#### Explore the data set

```{r}
head(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

#### 1. Create a boxplot of wind speed. 

```{r}
boxplot(airquality$Wind,main = "Wind Speed")
```

#### 2. Identify the values of the outliers in wind speed as identified by the boxplot.

```{r}
box = boxplot(airquality$Wind,main = "Wind Speed")
mytable = box$stats
colnames(mytable)<-box()$names
rownames(mytable)<-c('min','lower quartile','median','upper quartile','max')
mytable 

WindOut = subset(airquality, Wind > 16.6)
WindOut
```
Answer: the values of the ourliers in wind speed are 20.1, 18.4, 20.7



#### 3. What are the values of temperature on the days when the outliers in wind speed occurred?

```{r}
WindOut = subset(airquality, Wind > 16.6)
WindOut
```
Answer: the values of temperature on the days when the outliers in wind speed occurred are 61, 57, 72



#### 4. Create a scatterplot of wind speed versus temperature.

```{r}
WindSpeed = airquality$Wind
Temperature = airquality$Temp
plot(WindSpeed, Temperature, main="Wind Speed Versus Temperature", 
  	xlab="Wind Speed", ylab="Temperature")
```


#### 5. Compute the Pearson correlation between wind speed and temperature.

```{r}
WindSpeed = airquality$Wind
Temperature = airquality$Temp
cor(WindSpeed, Temperature, method ="pearson")
```

#### 6. Describe the linear association between wind speed and temperature.

Answer: The pearson correlation between wind speed and temperature is -0.4579879, which represents a negative association.

#### 7. Using boxplots display the distribution of temperature by month.

```{r}
boxplot(Temp ~ Month, data = airquality, xlab = "Months", ylab = "Temperature", main = "Distribution of Temperature by Month")
```


#### 8. Which of the months has the largest mean temperature?

```{r}
tapply(airquality$Temp, airquality$Month, mean)
```

Answer: August


#### 9. Which of the months has the lowest SD of temperature?

```{r}
tapply(airquality$Temp, airquality$Month, sd)
```

Answer: July


#### 10. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between wind speed and temperature for each month separately.

```{r}
May = subset(airquality, airquality$Month == 5)
June = subset(airquality,airquality$Month == 6)
July = subset(airquality,airquality$Month == 7)
August = subset(airquality,airquality$Month == 8)
September = subset(airquality,airquality$Month == 9)
CorMay = cor(May$Wind, May$Temp, method ="pearson")
CorJune = cor(June$Wind, June$Temp, method ="pearson")
CorJuly = cor(July$Wind, July$Temp, method ="pearson")
CorAugust = cor(August$Wind, August$Temp, method ="pearson")
CorSeptember = cor(September$Wind, September$Temp, method ="pearson")
CorMay
CorJune
CorJuly 
CorAugust
CorSeptember
```


```{r}
with(airquality,data.frame(
CorMay,
CorJune,
CorJuly,
CorAugust,
CorSeptember
))
```

Anwser: the Pearson correlation coefficient between wind speed and temperature for May is -0.373276, for June is -0.1210353, for July is -0.3052355, for August is -0.5076146, for September is -0.5704701.

#### 11. How many days have a wind speed greater than 10 mph?

```{r}
day = subset(airquality,airquality$Wind >10)
nrow(day)
```


#### 12. What is the mean and SD of temperature on days when the wind speed is greater than 10mph?


```{r}
wind = subset(airquality, airquality$Wind > 10)
mean(wind$Temp)
sd(wind$Temp)
```

```{r}
with(wind,data.frame(
Temp_Mean=tapply(Temp, Day, mean),
Temp_sd=tapply(Temp, Day, sd)))
```



## Data Set 2: brfss


#### 13. Read the data file brfss.csv into R. How many records (rows) are in the file? (Hint: use the ‘read.csv’ function)

```{r}
brfss = read.csv("brfss.csv")
nrow(brfss)
```


#### 14. Create a relative frequency distribution of the variable male. How many males and females are in the sample?

```{r}
head(brfss)
table(brfss$male)
```


Answer: There are 6683 males and 11016 femails.


#### 15. Create a binary indicator variable for age of 65 or greater. How many individuals of age 65 or greater are there in the sample?

```{r}
x = with(brfss, age >= 65)
#with(brfss,data.frame(x,y))
table(x)
```

Answer: 4643 individuals of age 65 or greater are in the sample.



#### 16. Create a cross-tabulation of male gender versus age 65 or greater. Describe the association between these two variables.


```{r}
age65 = with(brfss, age >= 65)
male = with(brfss, male == 1)
table(age65,male)
```



#### 17. Create histograms of age for males and females separately.  Describe one difference between the distribution of age for the two groups. 

```{r}
male = subset(brfss, brfss$male == 1)
female = subset(brfss, brfss$male == 0)
hist(male$age, main ="Distribution of Age for Female", col="lightgreen", xlim=c(0,100),  ylim=c(0, 1200))
hist(female$age, main = "Distribution of Age for Male",col="lightblue", xlim=c(0,100),  ylim=c(0, 1200))
```

Answer: the number(frequency) of male are greater than female.



#### 18. Create a relative frequency distribution of the variable state. Which state has the most individuals in the sample?


```{r}
table(brfss$state)
```

Answer: state 53 has the most individuals in the sample


#### 19. Create a cross-tabulation of state versus male gender. Which state has the most males in the sample?


```{r}
table(brfss$state,brfss$male == 1)
```

 
Answer: state 53 has the most males in the sample


#### 20. Which state has the largest proportion of males?

```{r}
tapply(brfss$male, brfss$state, mean)
```

Answer: state 56 has the largest proportion of males


#### 21. How many individuals have missing values of bmi? (Hint: missing values are denoted by NA. The function ‘is.na’ can be used to identify them.)


```{r}
sum(is.na(brfss$bmi))
```

Answer: 891 individuals have missing values of bmi


#### 22. Which state has the highest proportion of individuals with missing bmi?

```{r}
tapply(is.na(brfss$bmi), brfss$state, mean)
```

Answer: state 4 has the highest proportion of individuals with missing bmi


#### 23. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of bmi, excluding the missing values. 


```{r}
mean(na.omit(brfss$bmi))
sd(na.omit(brfss$bmi))
```

Answer: the mean of bmi is 27.38519 and standard deviation is 5.825888, excluding the missing values


#### 24. Use boxplots to compare the distribution of bmi across states. 


```{r}
boxplot(bmi ~ state, data=brfss)
```



#### 25. Which state has the highest mean bmi?


```{r}
tapply(brfss$bmi,brfss$state, mean)
```
